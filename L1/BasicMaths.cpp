/*
Modular Arithmetic

M = 1e9 + 7

--> Significance of 1e9 + 7 =  very close to int max value , in Multiplicative inverse cannot be calculated for all numbers , 1e9 + 7 is prime number actually so  multiplicative inverse can be calculated easily.

--> In A % M , the result of this operation is always lesser than M
