1.for every single Greedy Problem there exists a brute force solution
2.when u make certain observations then u think of greedy solns , when u prove certain ideas
3.there is no standard greedy algos 
4.Greedy Strategy = A strategy that assumes that the best answer can be found using some
(not all) possibilities and only tries out those limited possibilities
 It involves coming up with a claim (greedy) and then proving it

5.to prove your Greedy Strategy 
  --> u have some mathematical equations / formal or intuituive proof
  --> Trying out too many cases and failing to disprove

6.u come up with a greedy strategy and u tryout multiple cases , even if one the cases u r greedy startegy 
does not give up best answer , then your strategy is wrong 

7. u r greedy strategy shld work for almost all cases , in any of the case it fails , it must not be your algo , it must be 
where u r strategy cannot be applied then tht is ok , if on applying , when it can be  applied , it fails it means the strategy 
is wrong

8. if we say tht we tried out all the possible cases and the strategy worked on all of them , then it is the correct strategy
9. for formal proof , we have to write mathematical eqns and tht is how u prove it
10. Greedy is subjective , not all problems are intuitive for everyone 
11. we dont have to try out all the cases , we'll have a strategy tht works 
12. in cp problems , if the order of the elements doesnt matter then sort the array/vector and then start thinking  abt the problem this 
is for any CP problem , sorted arrays are easier to visualize 
13. anything that is obvious for u , u dont have to prove it , anything which u r not 100% sure , u always have to  prove it before submitting
14. when im saying a greedy strategy works on a particular set of data or type of data , does it mean it cannot work on any other type of data? No
it means tht i have proved tht greedy stratedy works on this type of data , i havent prove tht this greedy strategy also works on other particular 
type of data , but it does not mean that it'll not work on any other data.
15.so there can be certain cases in greedy where greedy strategy just works and u dont know why it works.
16. so when we are saying how do we solve a problem , we look at the problem , we look at the data or observations in the problem
then we make a claim , we prove the claim , when we are proving the claim it means tht this claim works for the data given in the problem
this claim can also work for someother problem with someother data but tht would require separate proof for tht
