1.for every single Greedy Problem there exists a brute force solution
2.when u make certain observations then u think of greedy solns , when u prove certain ideas
3.there is no standard greedy algos 
4.Greedy Strategy = A strategy that assumes that the best answer can be found using some
(not all) possibilities and only tries out those limited possibilities
 It involves coming up with a claim (greedy) and then proving it

5.to prove your Greedy Strategy 
  --> u have some mathematical equations / formal or intuituive proof
  --> Trying out too many cases and failing to disprove

6.u come up with a greedy strategy and u tryout multiple cases , even if one the cases u r greedy startegy 
does not give up best answer , then your strategy is wrong 

7. u r greedy strategy shld work for almost all cases , in any of the case it fails , it must not be your algo , it must be 
where u r strategy cannot be applied then tht is ok , if on applying , when it can be  applied , it fails it means the strategy 
is wrong

8.if we say tht we tried out all the possible cases and the strategy worked on all of them , then it is the correct strategy

9.  for formal proof , we have to write mathematical eqns and tht is how u prove it
10. Greedy is subjective , not all problems are intuitive for everyone
11. we dont have to try out all the cases , we'll have a strategy tht works 
12. in cp problems , if the order of the elements doesnt matter then sort the array/vector and then start thinking  abt the problem this 
for any CP problem
